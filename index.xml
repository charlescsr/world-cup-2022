&lt;h1 id=&#34;argentina&#34;&gt;Argentina&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last dance for Messi and Di Maria for sure will be bittersweet to watch as a Messi fan so I am planning to soak every moment. Messi has finally hit his GOAT stride at PSG so he is in really great form heading into the WC. Dybala&amp;rsquo;s injury will certainly be a big blow for them but they have capable players in Di Maria, Gomez and Alvarez. A solid defense led by Martinez in goal and Lisandro Martinez who has had a fantastic start to his United career. A really good midfield with the likes of Paredes, De Paul(Messi&amp;rsquo;s personal bodyguard), Lo Celso and more and an attack with La Pulga Lautaro should make Argentina at least go further in the knockouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youngters-to-watch-perezrb-alvarezst-palacioscdm&#34;&gt;Youngters to watch: Perez(RB), Alvarez(ST), Palacios(CDM)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;saudi-arabia&#34;&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hardly know players from this team. All I can bring is their WC 2018 form where they finished 3rd after beating an Egypt side who had a half-fit Mo Salah. Apart from that at the time of writing this they still have a friendly against Croatia on the 16th of November so maybe that&amp;rsquo;s one match to keep an eye on to see how they will play but in all honesty, they have really tough competition in Mexico, Argentina and even Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mexico&#34;&gt;Mexico&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Round of 16 in the last WC. Same record as Sweden(2-0-1). They have their version of Neuer in Ochoa. Their attack is their main threat with the likes of Raúl Jiménez, Hirving Lozano. They have some promising youngsters in &lt;strong&gt;Giménez(ST)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alvarez(CDM)&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how they hold up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;poland&#34;&gt;Poland&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time at the WC for people like Lewandowski, Szczęsny and a few more. Lewandowski will always be a starter and Milik is an option off the bench or as a winger. Zieliński is someone who can be good in the midfield area. The defense is rather good with the likes of Bednarek, Glik and Cash. Poland and Argentina should be a really great watch to see.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Group B - Summary</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;england&#34;&gt;England&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An absolute golden generation of players continuously ruined by a terrible manager (Seriously can&amp;rsquo;t wait till Howe or Potter manages this team). Anyways, they are pretty strong favorites to top the group but something is telling me in the later stages they can get found out. Patience is needed to break them down due to the 5 at the back system and their pace on the counter. Players to watch among a few are Sterling, Foden, Kane, and Mount. Keep an eye on Bellingham. Massive season so far and hoping he makes a bang in the WC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youngster-to-watch-bellingham-cm&#34;&gt;Youngster to watch: Bellingham (CM)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iran&#34;&gt;Iran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have outside pressure to be replaced for Ukraine. Putting all that aside they have an ok team. Wales and the USA mean their work is cut out for them. Sardar Azmoun will be absolutely pivotal for them if he manages to stay fit and get service from the others. Alireza Jahanbakhsh is a fairly decent player. Maybe a few surprises could pop up from them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usa&#34;&gt;USA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US national team. Not as successful as their female counterparts but now they have quite a promising roster of young talent. We have gone from Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey to the likes of Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna. They have a good keeper in Matt Turner(Arsenal). A really decent midfield with the likes of Mckennie, Tyler Adams and Reyna. Maybe only a lack of experience is the only drawback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youngsters-to-watch-weahst-busiocm--adamscdm&#34;&gt;Youngsters to watch: Weah(ST), Busio(CM),  Adams(CDM)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wales&#34;&gt;Wales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wales is another team who is fairly average but have got good quality in some positions. Bale is always the main talisman for them. Brennan Johnson and Dan James are not bad. The goalie spot is the only one that doesn&amp;rsquo;t give much confidence with Danny Ward being poor and Hennessey hardly getting game time ahead of Dean Henderson. If the GK spot is somehow sorted before the start maybe they could do decent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youngsters-to-watch-johnsonrw-williamsrb&#34;&gt;Youngsters to watch: Johnson(RW), Williams(RB)&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Group A - Summary</title>
      <link>https://charlescsr.github.io/world-cup-2022/posts/group-a/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;group-a&#34;&gt;Group A&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;qatar&#34;&gt;Qatar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hosts of this World Cup. The reason for the shocking time to hold it. No use chatting about it now. Looking back on their previous games, the last game was a 2-0 win against Guatemala with 2 penalties. They did win a game against Egypt on penalties(They were without Salah and many major players but it still was a win). However, they are in for an uphill battle as they are grouped with Africa Cup of Nations winners Senegal, the Netherlands and a decent Ecuador. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what they can manage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ecuador&#34;&gt;Ecuador&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at just their Copa America run recently gone by they were quarterfinalists but got humbled extremely by eventual winners Argentina. I think they could be good for maybe best placed 3rd team but apart from that I don&amp;rsquo;t see them being ahead of Senegal and the Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;senegal&#34;&gt;Senegal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African Cup of Nations winners. They have quite a decent team that could challenge the Dutch and mostly do deserve to go at maximum 2nd place. Their last game was a 1-1 draw to Iran however and there are no more matches scheduled which doesn&amp;rsquo;t give much confidence but they have the capable players to go to at least the quarters if they get the right draw. Mane and Dia are the main men in attack. Mane is a big threat down the left and Dia down the middle. The midfield of Gueye and Mendy is alright not amazing but not bad. Sarr is a good winger to have as well. At the back, Koulibaly will have to be the main man for them as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youngsters-to-watch-ismaila-sarrrm-ismail-jakobslb&#34;&gt;Youngsters to watch: Ismaila Sarr(RM), Ismail Jakobs(LB)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;netherlands&#34;&gt;Netherlands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overwhelming favorites to top the group in my opinion. Louis Van Gaal has come back with a bang and the team has developed well. Van Dijk, De Ligt and Timber is a solid back 3 with depth in the fullbacks as well with Blind and Dumfries and Malacia and Frimpong. Midfield is maybe somewhere they have to be alert in cause I don&amp;rsquo;t think they have the greatest players in Berghuis, De Roon and Klaasen(This midfield however managed to beat Belgium 1-0 in the Nations League so it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad). Gravenberch could add some quality in that area if needed but he&amp;rsquo;s hardly playing for Bayern. The attack is where the firepower lies. Gakpo, Bergwijn, Depay, Malen to name a few. An outside shout is probably Xavi Simons from PSV to add to it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youngsters-to-watch-gakpolw-timbercb-malacialb&#34;&gt;Youngsters to watch: Gakpo(LW), Timber(CB), Malacia(LB)&lt;/h3&gt;
