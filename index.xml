&lt;p&gt;Just to make sure the spaces are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goalkeepers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defenders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midfielders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attackers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WC Finalists last time out. Looking at the squad strength, they have a good midfield and a fairly decent target man in Kramaric(Despite my personal feeling about him). Gvardiol at the back should be OTW. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing he will be paired with Lovren who isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly the fastest currently so maybe you can get at him. In the fullbacks, you have Sosa for the LB position and Vida and Juranovic at RB. In midfield, the 3 picks themselves: Brozovic(CDM), Kovacic and Modric(CM). Up front, we could mostly see Vlasic and Perisic with Kramaric(ST)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lineup would look as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;../lineup_croatia.png&#34;

        alt=&#34;Screenshot_20221110_225130.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, defending champs. Strong squad. The only thing I am probably worried about is the lack of fullbacks with only Pavard and Theo Hernandez. No Ferland Mendy which is surprising. Maybe it could mean Deschamps is trying to push the 3 at the back system I think. Glad to see Varane in the squad still despite him missing the first game as a United fan. The midfield will be without Pogba and Kante who are very influential in general but in their stead, I am hoping Camavinga and Tchouameni will step up. They have been developing really well at Real Madrid so let u see how they do. The forward line will be Mbappe obviously. Along with him, I think Benzema would be great to have as Mbappe has said he would work well in a 2 ST formation. So keeping that in mind, if Deschamps wanted the 3 back formation,  it would probably look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;../lineup_france_1.png&#34;
        alt=&#34;lineup_france_1.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we looked at a different type of formation then this could be worth a shout:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img  src=&#34;../lineup_france_2.png&#34;

      <title>Group H - Summary</title>
      <link>https://charlescsr.github.io/world-cup-2022/posts/group-h/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 19:22:00 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://charlescsr.github.io/world-cup-2022/posts/group-h/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;group-h&#34;&gt;Group H&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;portugal&#34;&gt;Portugal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite possibly the last dance for Ronaldo he isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly in the greatest of form but will most definitely be leading out this team in a tough group with the likes of Uruguay and so on. Unlucky that Diogo Jota is injured for this tournament. The attack is really well stacked anyways with the likes of Neto and Felix. The midfield has the likes of Bruno, Silva, Rafa Leao and Neves. The youngsters to watch could be Vitinha and M. Nunes. In defense, we have a solid group of players in Dias, Pepe, Cancelo and Dalot. Mendes is a young LB to watch. GK has some interesting ones like Patricio, Jose Sa and a younger keeper in Costa. Hope he could get some games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ghana&#34;&gt;Ghana&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghana has a good team. I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about the keeper but they have quality in other areas. The fact that they&amp;rsquo;re paired with Uruguay after what happened in &lt;a href=&#34;http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8785140.stm&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt;
 is going to be interesting to see. In defense, you can see the likes of Lamptey(OTW - One to Watch), Salisu(OTW) and Amartey. The midfield has a good CDM in Thomas Partey and a good CM/CAM in Kudus(Ajax OTW) and attack, they have the Ayew brothers obviously. Another youngster to watch could be Felix Afena Gyan if he&amp;rsquo;s selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uruguay&#34;&gt;Uruguay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good young talents have arrived in Uruguay and hoping to see them all come good. GK is obviously Muslera. The defense has the likes of Gimenez and Araujo(Man&amp;rsquo;s injured unfortunately). Midfield has really good quality with Fede Valverde(Absolutely on fire for Real Madrid), Pellistri(Hopefully has a good tournament. Young and OTW), Torreira and Vecino. In attack, we have got the likes of Nunez. I am not sure if both Suarez and Cavani will be selected. Maxi Gomez is another one who is fairly decent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;korea&#34;&gt;Korea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known famously for knocking Germany out with a wonderful performance, Son will be hoping to have a good tournament this time around. I only know probably 3 players overall. Kim Min-Jae will hopefully be a rock at the back with his form for Napoli. Hwang Hee-Chan and Son up front is a really good threat. With the quality of the other teams, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say how well they could do. Then again they knocked out Germany so you never know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Group G - Summary</title>
      <link>https://charlescsr.github.io/world-cup-2022/posts/group-g/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 19:22:00 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://charlescsr.github.io/world-cup-2022/posts/group-g/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;group-g&#34;&gt;Group G&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;brazil&#34;&gt;Brazil&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can Brazil finally make sure to win another World Cup after 2002? Can Neymar banish the ghosts of the critics by winning a WC finally? These are the few questions that I am most certainly thinking about when coming to Brazil. I would really like to see the South American teams giving a tough fight to the European teams. In the last world cup, even with Neymar they went out on a whimper in the knockouts which was disappointing, to say the least. Now hopefully Tite can get the absolute best out of this team. In goal, it&amp;rsquo;s a toss-up between Alisson and Ederson. In defense, we have the rock-solid pair of Marquinhos and Thiago Silva. Fullbacks are my only worry with this team with options like Danilo, Telles and Sandro. Midfield is also really solid with the likes of Casemiro, Fred, Bruno G(Having a stonking season for Newcastle) and Fabinho. The attack is absolutely stacked with obviously Neymar, Gabriel Jesus, Rodrygo, Antony, Martinelli, Vini Jr. God that attack is good if it gels together which the coach has to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;serbia&#34;&gt;Serbia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group low-key has teams that should probably not be underestimated apart from Brazil only. I don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone in particular in their defense apart from their goalie(Dmitrovic). Midfield is quite decent with the likes of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sofascore.com/player/sergej-milinkovic-savic/331447&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;SMS&lt;/a&gt;
, Tadic, Kostic, Gudelj and Racic. The attack has options in Mitrovic and Jovic. Vlahovic is a doubt due to his injury so we don&amp;rsquo;t know if the manager will pick him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;switzerland&#34;&gt;Switzerland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this team on their day with the players they have could be really good and finish 2nd in this group. They had a wonderful Euros by beating France in a penalty shootout. Sommer is the mainstay at GK with a younger one in the wings in Kobel. Defense will mostly be Rodriguez, Akanji, Schar and Mbaby which is alright. Midfield has the likes of Xhaka(In good form for Arsenal), Zakaria, Freuler. The attack is obviously incomplete with the Big Shaq(X. Shaquiri - RW) and Embolo and led by the imposing Seferovic. I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on Noah Okafor if he gets selected for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cameroon&#34;&gt;Cameroon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Eto&amp;rsquo;o was the main player back then, they have pretty much an equal replacement for him now: Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. As much as I laugh at him, he has absolutely been on it for Bayern this season and deserves the call-up. He will be a big threat based on form. Along with him could also be Mbuemo as well on the right as a threat. Midfield has the likes of Toko-Ekambi and Frank Anguissa which is really good. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know anybody major in defense apart from the GK(Andre Onana).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Group F - Summary</title>
      <link>https://charlescsr.github.io/world-cup-2022/posts/group-f/</link>

      <guid>https://charlescsr.github.io/world-cup-2022/posts/group-f/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;group-f&#34;&gt;Group F&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;belgium&#34;&gt;Belgium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Belgium, one problem I have always found is their defense somehow always lets them down and with the guard being Vertonghen(35), Alderweireld(33) and Boyata(31) I am not surprised. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be as big an issue now due to the rise of young CBs such as Faes(24) and Theate(22) combined with the experience of Denayer(27) should be a really good backline for Courtois now. The midfield is absolutely packed with the likes of De Bruyne, Tielemans, Witsel and so on with young talents like Onana(21) for the CDM role. On the wings, we have the ever present Eden Hazard, his brother Thorgan, Carrasco, Mertens along with young talents like De Ketelaere(ST) and Openda(ST). Will be keeping an eye on those talents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;canada&#34;&gt;Canada&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First WC since 1986. Phonzy(A. Davies - LB) and his men have a big task on their hands qualifying ahead of the likes of Croatia and Belgium who have pretty decent firepower on their side. Davies is also expected to be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transfermarkt.com/alphonso-davies-quot-i-will-be-100-for-the-world-cup-quot-canada-back-for-first-time-since-1986/view/news/413584&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;back&lt;/a&gt;
 just before the WC starts which is great news and will be on the left side of the defense. Another talent I want to keep an eye on is Jonathan David(ST). The young striker is doing numbers for Lille in France but this WC could be a good way to gauge his play style and see how he works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;morocco&#34;&gt;Morocco&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morocco don&amp;rsquo;t have a bad squad but with the likes of Belgium and Croatia, we don&amp;rsquo;t know if they can manage it. They have good players. Starting from defense they have Bono who plays for Sevilla and half-decent CBs in Saïss and Aguerd(Plays for West Ham) and the fullbacks have the quality of Hakimi and Mazraoui. The midfield is pretty standard with the likes of Amrabat, Boufal, Harit(One to keep an eye on) and the attack has the likes of Ziyech, En-Nesyri so it is not half bad. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if they can give tough competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;croatia&#34;&gt;Croatia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finalists from the previous WC, Croatia won a load of hearts from that tournament for sure and they have a really good team to push Belgium and go through. In goal will probably be Livakovic. Gvardiol at the back is one to watch along with maybe Lovren. In midfield, the likes of Modric Kovacic and Brozovic are really solid. Up front, they have the likes of Kramaric(Man made me furious in a FIFA 22 Career mode I was doing and I dropped him). Brekalo and Pasalic could be good wing options maybe along with Vlasic.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://charlescsr.github.io/world-cup-2022/posts/group-e/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 19:22:00 +0530</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://charlescsr.github.io/world-cup-2022/posts/group-e/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;group-e&#34;&gt;Group E&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spain&#34;&gt;Spain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain has such a promising team in midfield and attack for sure. It all starts at the back with a great modern keeper in Unai Simon with Carvajal and Gaya at full-backs mostly and Torres and Laporte(if picked which is pretty certain). Midfield is amazing quality with Pedri and Gavi and Rodri holding fort over there. Pedri and Gavi are the ones to watch. Guillamón(CDM) is another one who is young and can play both CDM and CB. In attack, there are quite a few options in Ferran Torres, Sarabia and more with Morata or maybe Moreno at ST. The young players to watch here are Fati(LW), Nico Williams(RW), Yéremy Pino(RW) if they are selected. They can go far with Enrique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;costa-rica&#34;&gt;Costa Rica&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keylor Navas has a huge mountain to climb here sadly cause this group is mighty tough with Spain and Germany. Maybe they could give Japan a fight but apart from that, I have no idea if they could do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;germany&#34;&gt;Germany&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victims of the defending champions curse. They had a really solid team last time out but didn&amp;rsquo;t go beyond the group stages. Now they are looking much more dangerous under Hansi Flick. They have a good set of young players in Musiala, Bella-Kotchap(Who is pretty decent in the PL so far) and Moukoko. Hoping to see them go far in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;japan&#34;&gt;Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the old days when Japan had players like Shinji Kagawa and Keisuke Honda who would absolutely ball out for Japan. Now there is a new wave of talent for these guys and I&amp;rsquo;m excited for it. The attack has players like Minamino, Kamada and Furuhashi. The wings are dangerous with the likes of Take Kubo and Ritsu Doan. In defense, we have the likes of Tomiyasu and Yoshida. Itakura is also someone who could be decent for them. There is a good bundle of talent here. Let&amp;rsquo;s see&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;group-d&#34;&gt;Group D&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;france&#34;&gt;France&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defending champions. Will the World Cup curse strike for the 4th time? (Victims include: Italy, Spain, and Germany). They have got an amazing team. In defense, although Varane will be a big miss, they have got the likes of Koundé, Konaté, Upamecano, Saliba, Lucas, Theo and Pavard. In Midfield, Kante is a huge miss but there is quality again in Tchouaméni and Camavinga who are promising and are ones to watch for. Paul Pogba can still do the business for France and can hopefully do good after coming back from injury(&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1587123217201713152&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;Immediate Jinx&lt;/a&gt;
). Diaby and Guendouzi are also youngsters to keep an eye on. Dembele has had a massive resurrection at Barca so expect to see more of him. There is just a lot of quality to cover. Mbappe will always be the main man up top for the French. One thing is: Will we see Ballon D&amp;rsquo;Or winner Benzema at the WC? Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;australia&#34;&gt;Australia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know their players as much apart from Mat Ryan(GK) and Mooy(CM). They are mostly going to be fighting with Tunisia for 3rd and 4th mostly. They arrived here by beating Peru via a penalty shootout(after a 0-0 draw)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;denmark&#34;&gt;Denmark&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guys balled out in the Euros. A semi-final appearance in that tournament. They have got the team to finish comfortably in 2nd place in this group. Eriksen is a man reborn ever since the &lt;a href=&#34;https://charlescsr.github.io/euro-diaries-2020/posts/day-1/&#34;target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;bad news&lt;/a&gt;
 from the Euros and he will be a pivotal part once again for the Danish. Kasper Schmeichel is once again a great leader to have and a good keeper. Kjaer and Christensen will be vital at the heart of the defense. Maele and Damsgaard are good on the wings with Damsgaard hoping to back up his great Euros performance with another one here. Up front, the options are fairly decent in Dolberg and Poulsen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tunisia&#34;&gt;Tunisia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only know 2 players here in Khazri and Mejbri. Excited to see Mejbri if he does get called up which I hope he does. The last match wasn&amp;rsquo;t a great one: losing 5-1 to Brazil and getting a player sent off. Apart from that, another notable player is Skhiri who plays in the Bundesliga for Koln.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;group-c&#34;&gt;Group C&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;argentina&#34;&gt;Argentina&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last dance for Messi and Di Maria for sure will be bittersweet to watch as a Messi fan so I am planning to soak every moment. Messi has finally hit his GOAT stride at PSG so he is in really great form heading into the WC. Dybala&amp;rsquo;s injury will certainly be a big blow for them but they have capable players in Di Maria, Gomez and Alvarez. A solid defense led by Martinez in goal and Lisandro Martinez who has had a fantastic start to his United career. A really good midfield with the likes of Paredes, De Paul(Messi&amp;rsquo;s personal bodyguard), Lo Celso and more and an attack with La Pulga Lautaro should make Argentina at least go further in the knockouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youngters-to-watch-perezrb-alvarezst-palacioscdm&#34;&gt;Youngters to watch: Perez(RB), Alvarez(ST), Palacios(CDM)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;saudi-arabia&#34;&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hardly know players from this team. All I can bring is their WC 2018 form where they finished 3rd after beating an Egypt side who had a half-fit Mo Salah. Apart from that at the time of writing this they still have a friendly against Croatia on the 16th of November so maybe that&amp;rsquo;s one match to keep an eye on to see how they will play but in all honesty, they have really tough competition in Mexico, Argentina and even Poland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mexico&#34;&gt;Mexico&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Round of 16 in the last WC. Same record as Sweden(2-0-1). They have their version of Neuer in Ochoa. Their attack is their main threat with the likes of Raúl Jiménez, Hirving Lozano. They have some promising youngsters in &lt;strong&gt;Giménez(ST)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alvarez(CDM)&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how they hold up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;poland&#34;&gt;Poland&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time at the WC for people like Lewandowski, Szczęsny and a few more. Lewandowski will always be a starter and Milik is an option off the bench or as a winger. Zieliński is someone who can be good in the midfield area. The defense is rather good with the likes of Bednarek, Glik and Cash. Poland and Argentina should be a really great watch to see.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;group-b&#34;&gt;Group B&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;england&#34;&gt;England&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An absolute golden generation of players continuously ruined by a terrible manager (Seriously can&amp;rsquo;t wait till Howe or Potter manages this team). Anyways, they are pretty strong favorites to top the group but something is telling me in the later stages they can get found out. Patience is needed to break them down due to the 5 at the back system and their pace on the counter. Players to watch among a few are Sterling, Foden, Kane, and Mount. Keep an eye on Bellingham. Massive season so far and hoping he makes a bang in the WC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youngster-to-watch-bellingham-cm&#34;&gt;Youngster to watch: Bellingham (CM)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iran&#34;&gt;Iran&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have outside pressure to be replaced for Ukraine. Putting all that aside they have an ok team. Wales and the USA mean their work is cut out for them. Sardar Azmoun will be absolutely pivotal for them if he manages to stay fit and get service from the others. Alireza Jahanbakhsh is a fairly decent player. Maybe a few surprises could pop up from them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usa&#34;&gt;USA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US national team. Not as successful as their female counterparts but now they have quite a promising roster of young talent. We have gone from Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey to the likes of Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna. They have a good keeper in Matt Turner(Arsenal). A really decent midfield with the likes of Mckennie, Tyler Adams and Reyna. Maybe only a lack of experience is the only drawback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;wales&#34;&gt;Wales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wales is another team who is fairly average but have got good quality in some positions. Bale is always the main talisman for them. Brennan Johnson and Dan James are not bad. The goalie spot is the only one that doesn&amp;rsquo;t give much confidence with Danny Ward being poor and Hennessey hardly getting game time ahead of Dean Henderson. If the GK spot is somehow sorted before the start maybe they could do decent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;qatar&#34;&gt;Qatar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hosts of this World Cup. The reason for the shocking time to hold it. No use chatting about it now. Looking back on their previous games, the last game was a 2-0 win against Guatemala with 2 penalties. They did win a game against Egypt on penalties(They were without Salah and many major players but it still was a win). However, they are in for an uphill battle as they are grouped with Africa Cup of Nations winners Senegal, the Netherlands and a decent Ecuador. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what they can manage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ecuador&#34;&gt;Ecuador&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at just their Copa America run recently gone by they were quarterfinalists but got humbled extremely by eventual winners Argentina. I think they could be good for maybe best placed 3rd team but apart from that I don&amp;rsquo;t see them being ahead of Senegal and the Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;senegal&#34;&gt;Senegal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African Cup of Nations winners. They have quite a decent team that could challenge the Dutch and mostly do deserve to go at maximum 2nd place. Their last game was a 1-1 draw to Iran however and there are no more matches scheduled which doesn&amp;rsquo;t give much confidence but they have the capable players to go to at least the quarters if they get the right draw. Mane and Dia are the main men in attack. Mane is a big threat down the left and Dia down the middle. The midfield of Gueye and Mendy is alright not amazing but not bad. Sarr is a good winger to have as well. At the back, Koulibaly will have to be the main man for them as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youngsters-to-watch-ismaila-sarrrm-ismail-jakobslb&#34;&gt;Youngsters to watch: Ismaila Sarr(RM), Ismail Jakobs(LB)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;netherlands&#34;&gt;Netherlands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overwhelming favorites to top the group in my opinion. Louis Van Gaal has come back with a bang and the team has developed well. Van Dijk, De Ligt and Timber is a solid back 3 with depth in the fullbacks as well with Blind and Dumfries and Malacia and Frimpong. Midfield is maybe somewhere they have to be alert in cause I don&amp;rsquo;t think they have the greatest players in Berghuis, De Roon and Klaasen(This midfield however managed to beat Belgium 1-0 in the Nations League so it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad). Frenkie De Jong has finally hit some consistent games for Barca so hoping he gets in. Gravenberch could add some quality in that area if needed but he&amp;rsquo;s hardly playing for Bayern. The attack is where the firepower lies. Gakpo, Bergwijn, Depay, Malen to name a few. An outside shout is probably Xavi Simons from PSV to add to it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;youngsters-to-watch-gakpolw-timbercb-malacialb&#34;&gt;Youngsters to watch: Gakpo(LW), Timber(CB), Malacia(LB)&lt;/h3&gt;
