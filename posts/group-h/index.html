<h2 id="portugal">Portugal</h2>
<p>Quite possibly the last dance for Ronaldo he isn&rsquo;t exactly in the greatest of form but will most definitely be leading out this team in a tough group with the likes of Uruguay and so on. Unlucky that Diogo Jota is injured for this tournament. The attack is really well stacked anyways with the likes of Neto and Felix. The midfield has the likes of Bruno, Silva, Rafa Leao and Neves. The youngsters to watch could be Vitinha and M. Nunes. In defense, we have a solid group of players in Dias, Pepe, Cancelo and Dalot. Mendes is a young LB to watch. GK has some interesting ones like Patricio, Jose Sa and a younger keeper in Costa. Hope he could get some games.</p>
<h2 id="ghana">Ghana</h2>
<p>Ghana has a good team. I don&rsquo;t know much about the keeper but they have quality in other areas. The fact that they&rsquo;re paired with Uruguay after what happened in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8785140.stm"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2010</a>
 is going to be interesting to see. In defense, you can see the likes of Lamptey(OTW - One to Watch), Salisu(OTW) and Amartey. The midfield has a good CDM in Thomas Partey and a good CM/CAM in Kudus(Ajax OTW) and attack, they have the Ayew brothers obviously. Another youngster to watch could be Felix Afena Gyan if he&rsquo;s selected.</p>
<h2 id="uruguay">Uruguay</h2>
<p>Good young talents have arrived in Uruguay and hoping to see them all come good. GK is obviously Muslera. The defense has the likes of Gimenez and Araujo(Man&rsquo;s injured unfortunately). Midfield has really good quality with Fede Valverde(Absolutely on fire for Real Madrid), Pellistri(Hopefully has a good tournament. Young and OTW), Torreira and Vecino. In attack, we have got the likes of Nunez. I am not sure if both Suarez and Cavani will be selected. Maxi Gomez is another one who is fairly decent.</p>
<h2 id="korea">Korea</h2>
<p>Known famously for knocking Germany out with a wonderful performance, Son will be hoping to have a good tournament this time around. I only know probably 3 players overall. Kim Min-Jae will hopefully be a rock at the back with his form for Napoli. Hwang Hee-Chan and Son up front is a really good threat. With the quality of the other teams, it&rsquo;s hard to say how well they could do. Then again they knocked out Germany so you never know.</p>
