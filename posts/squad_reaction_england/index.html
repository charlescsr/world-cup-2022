<p>The big one I was actually waiting for. My expectations for Southgate were low but wow he absolutely went even low. Heavy imbalance, too many out-of-form players, some fatigue and dropping people who you would rather build the team around. It&rsquo;s an absolute joke how the FA(Football Association) is allowing this League 1(Tier 3 of English football) coach even manage a bloody NATIONAL TEAM. The worst part of it is they are scared to hire anyone foreign. Anyways, the bottom line is it&rsquo;s sad seeing a golden generation of attacking talent being wasted by a very conservative coach. Alright anymore and this post will be very big so let&rsquo;s decipher the lineup and you bet your top dollar I am doing a best-ever England lineup as well.</p>
<p>In goal, I am fine with the picks of Pickford, Pope and Ramsdale with Pickford being the de facto starter. At the back I am certain it&rsquo;s a back 3 of Dier, Maguire and Stones. On the left Shaw is mostly a lock and on the right, I would trust Trippier based on his form for Newcastle. Going into midfield, it picks itself with Rice and Bellingham. Going forward, the left will mostly be between Sterling and Rashford. I would trust Rashford on form and Foden or Saka on the right with Kane leading the line.</p>
<p>The lineup will look something like this:</p>
<p><img  src="../lineup_eng_1.png"
        alt="lineup_eng_1.png"/></p>
<p>Here are a few things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>White was picked due to injuries to James and Chilwell</li>
<li>Only 1 LB and 5 RBs</li>
<li>5 CAMs for a formation that does not use a CAM</li>
<li>No different CB like Tomori or even Guehi</li>
<li>Bellingham only one outside England who is picked</li>
<li>No James Ward-Prowse despite being in amazing form</li>
<li>Kane is tired and his only backup is Wilson. No Toney or Tammy Abraham</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I would have done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Picked Tomori because he is a modern CB to partner Stones</li>
<li>Picked JWP on his amazing form</li>
<li>Picked Toney and Abraham along with Wilson and drop people like Grealish and Philips since they have hardly played and one of them was injured for a long time.</li>
<li>Switch to a 4 back formation to actually make use of the attacking talent</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how the lineup would look like:</p>
