<h1 id="argentina">Argentina</h1>
<p>The last dance for Messi and Di Maria for sure will be bittersweet to watch as a Messi fan so I am planning to soak every moment. Messi has finally hit his GOAT stride at PSG so he is in really great form heading into the WC. Dybala&rsquo;s injury will certainly be a big blow for them but they have capable players in Di Maria, Gomez and Alvarez. A solid defense led by Martinez in goal and Lisandro Martinez who has had a fantastic start to his United career. A really good midfield with the likes of Paredes, De Paul(Messi&rsquo;s personal bodyguard), Lo Celso and more and an attack with La Pulga Lautaro should make Argentina at least go further in the knockouts.</p>
<h3 id="youngters-to-watch-perezrb-alvarezst-palacioscdm">Youngters to watch: Perez(RB), Alvarez(ST), Palacios(CDM)</h3>
<h1 id="saudi-arabia">Saudi Arabia</h1>
<p>I hardly know players from this team. All I can bring is their WC 2018 form where they finished 3rd after beating an Egypt side who had a half-fit Mo Salah. Apart from that at the time of writing this they still have a friendly against Croatia on the 16th of November so maybe that&rsquo;s one match to keep an eye on to see how they will play but in all honesty, they have really tough competition in Mexico, Argentina and even Poland.</p>
<h1 id="mexico">Mexico</h1>
<p>Round of 16 in the last WC. Same record as Sweden(2-0-1). They have their version of Neuer in Ochoa. Their attack is their main threat with the likes of Raúl Jiménez, Hirving Lozano. They have some promising youngsters in <strong>Giménez(ST)</strong> and <strong>Alvarez(CDM)</strong>. Let&rsquo;s see how they hold up.</p>
<h1 id="poland">Poland</h1>
<p>The last time at the WC for people like Lewandowski, Szczęsny and a few more. Lewandowski will always be a starter and Milik is an option off the bench or as a winger. Zieliński is someone who can be good in the midfield area. The defense is rather good with the likes of Bednarek, Glik and Cash. Poland and Argentina should be a really great watch to see.</p>
