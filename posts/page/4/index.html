            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Belgium</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Belgium Like I said in my team summary this is a decent squad in general and the one selected for this tournament is no different. This team has been forever named a dark horse but with the sheer quality they have I expected them to do really well at tournaments but they haven&rsquo;t delivered as much as I thought. A 3rd place finish last time in the World Cup is good but not enough.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_morocco/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Morocco</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Morocco The order is: Goalkeepers, Defenders, Midfielders, Attackers
This is an okay team in my opinion. With the likes of Belgium and Croatia, it is an uphill battle for Morocco. Ziyech is selected despite playing fewer games and being out of form for Chelsea but I get the reasoning. You sometimes have to have your most talented players.
In goal, we have Bono who is a half-decent keeper for Sevilla and is no slouch.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_swi/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Switzerland</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Switzerland Credit to Goal.com for the simplification
Fairly decent time in the last Euros where they managed to knock out the current WC defending champions France on penalties. The squad is fairly decent with a few young options up front like Okafor and Embolo and a GK in Kobel. Sommer is injured but will be back in time for their first fixture maybe it could be time to trust in Kobel a little more.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_usa/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - USA</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - USA From the days of seeing only Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan, I have got to say I am liking the look of this USA team honestly. A good keeper in Matt Turner. Good defense in Robinson, Dest, Scally, Yedlin and Zimmerman. There is a decent midfield in Mckennie, Acosta, Aaronson and Adams. The forward line is also really good with the LeBron James of Soccer(C. Pulisic - LW), Gio Reyna who is doing well for Dortmund.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_cameroon/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Cameroon</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Cameroon Fairly normal squad you could say. I am excited to see how Choupo-Moting will perform after being in form for Bayern but I don&rsquo;t know if the coach will play him ahead of Aboubakar cause he is the captain of the team. Maybe he may play at LW but they already got Toko-Ekambi there and Mbuemo is a lock-in at RW. In midfield, the likes of Zambo Anguissa will be vital in shielding the defense.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_croatia/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Croatia</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Croatia Just to make sure the spaces are as follows:
Goalkeepers
Defenders
Midfielders
Attackers
WC Finalists last time out. Looking at the squad strength, they have a good midfield and a fairly decent target man in Kramaric(Despite my personal feeling about him). Gvardiol at the back should be OTW. I&rsquo;m guessing he will be paired with Lovren who isn&rsquo;t exactly the fastest currently so maybe you can get at him.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_france/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - France</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - France Alright, defending champs. Strong squad. The only thing I am probably worried about is the lack of fullbacks with only Pavard and Theo Hernandez. No Ferland Mendy which is surprising. Maybe it could mean Deschamps is trying to push the 3 at the back system I think. Glad to see Varane in the squad still despite him missing the first game as a United fan. The midfield will be without Pogba and Kante who are very influential in general but in their stead, I am hoping Camavinga and Tchouameni will step up.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-h/">
            <p class="note title">Group H - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-11-02</p><p class="note content">Group H Portugal Quite possibly the last dance for Ronaldo he isn&rsquo;t exactly in the greatest of form but will most definitely be leading out this team in a tough group with the likes of Uruguay and so on. Unlucky that Diogo Jota is injured for this tournament. The attack is really well stacked anyways with the likes of Neto and Felix. The midfield has the likes of Bruno, Silva, Rafa Leao and Neves.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-g/">
            <p class="note title">Group G - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-11-01</p><p class="note content">Group G Brazil Can Brazil finally make sure to win another World Cup after 2002? Can Neymar banish the ghosts of the critics by winning a WC finally? These are the few questions that I am most certainly thinking about when coming to Brazil. I would really like to see the South American teams giving a tough fight to the European teams. In the last world cup, even with Neymar they went out on a whimper in the knockouts which was disappointing, to say the least.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-f/">
            <p class="note title">Group F - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-31</p><p class="note content">Group F Belgium With Belgium, one problem I have always found is their defense somehow always lets them down and with the guard being Vertonghen(35), Alderweireld(33) and Boyata(31) I am not surprised. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be as big an issue now due to the rise of young CBs such as Faes(24) and Theate(22) combined with the experience of Denayer(27) should be a really good backline for Courtois now. The midfield is absolutely packed with the likes of De Bruyne, Tielemans, Witsel and so on with young talents like Onana(21) for the CDM role.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
