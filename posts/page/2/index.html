            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - USA</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - USA From the days of seeing only Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan, I have got to say I am liking the look of this USA team honestly. A good keeper in Matt Turner. Good defense in Robinson, Dest, Scally, Yedlin and Zimmerman. There is a decent midfield in Mckennie, Acosta, Aaronson and Adams. The forward line is also really good with the LeBron James of Soccer(C. Pulisic - LW), Gio Reyna who is doing well for Dortmund.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_cameroon/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Cameroon</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Cameroon Fairly normal squad you could say. I am excited to see how Choupo-Moting will perform after being in form for Bayern but I don&rsquo;t know if the coach will play him ahead of Aboubakar cause he is the captain of the team. Maybe he may play at LW but they already got Toko-Ekambi there and Mbuemo is a lock-in at RW. In midfield, the likes of Zambo Anguissa will be vital in shielding the defense.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_croatia/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Croatia</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Croatia Just to make sure the spaces are as follows:
Goalkeepers
Defenders
Midfielders
Attackers
WC Finalists last time out. Looking at the squad strength, they have a good midfield and a fairly decent target man in Kramaric(Despite my personal feeling about him). Gvardiol at the back should be OTW. I&rsquo;m guessing he will be paired with Lovren who isn&rsquo;t exactly the fastest currently so maybe you can get at him.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_france/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - France</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - France Alright, defending champs. Strong squad. The only thing I am probably worried about is the lack of fullbacks with only Pavard and Theo Hernandez. No Ferland Mendy which is surprising. Maybe it could mean Deschamps is trying to push the 3 at the back system I think. Glad to see Varane in the squad still despite him missing the first game as a United fan. The midfield will be without Pogba and Kante who are very influential in general but in their stead, I am hoping Camavinga and Tchouameni will step up.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-h/">
            <p class="note title">Group H - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-11-02</p><p class="note content">Group H Portugal Quite possibly the last dance for Ronaldo he isn&rsquo;t exactly in the greatest of form but will most definitely be leading out this team in a tough group with the likes of Uruguay and so on. Unlucky that Diogo Jota is injured for this tournament. The attack is really well stacked anyways with the likes of Neto and Felix. The midfield has the likes of Bruno, Silva, Rafa Leao and Neves.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-g/">
            <p class="note title">Group G - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-11-01</p><p class="note content">Group G Brazil Can Brazil finally make sure to win another World Cup after 2002? Can Neymar banish the ghosts of the critics by winning a WC finally? These are the few questions that I am most certainly thinking about when coming to Brazil. I would really like to see the South American teams giving a tough fight to the European teams. In the last world cup, even with Neymar they went out on a whimper in the knockouts which was disappointing, to say the least.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-f/">
            <p class="note title">Group F - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-31</p><p class="note content">Group F Belgium With Belgium, one problem I have always found is their defense somehow always lets them down and with the guard being Vertonghen(35), Alderweireld(33) and Boyata(31) I am not surprised. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be as big an issue now due to the rise of young CBs such as Faes(24) and Theate(22) combined with the experience of Denayer(27) should be a really good backline for Courtois now. The midfield is absolutely packed with the likes of De Bruyne, Tielemans, Witsel and so on with young talents like Onana(21) for the CDM role.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-e/">
            <p class="note title">Group E - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-30</p><p class="note content">Group E Spain Spain has such a promising team in midfield and attack for sure. It all starts at the back with a great modern keeper in Unai Simon with Carvajal and Gaya at full-backs mostly and Torres and Laporte(if picked which is pretty certain). Midfield is amazing quality with Pedri and Gavi and Rodri holding fort over there. Pedri and Gavi are the ones to watch. Guillamón(CDM) is another one who is young and can play both CDM and CB.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-d/">
            <p class="note title">Group D - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-29</p><p class="note content">Group D France Defending champions. Will the World Cup curse strike for the 4th time? (Victims include: Italy, Spain, and Germany). They have got an amazing team. In defense, although Varane will be a big miss, they have got the likes of Koundé, Konaté, Upamecano, Saliba, Lucas, Theo and Pavard. In Midfield, Kante is a huge miss but there is quality again in Tchouaméni and Camavinga who are promising and are ones to watch for.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-c/">
            <p class="note title">Group C - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-29</p><p class="note content">Group C Argentina The last dance for Messi and Di Maria for sure will be bittersweet to watch as a Messi fan so I am planning to soak every moment. Messi has finally hit his GOAT stride at PSG so he is in really great form heading into the WC. Dybala&rsquo;s injury will certainly be a big blow for them but they have capable players in Di Maria, Gomez and Alvarez.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
