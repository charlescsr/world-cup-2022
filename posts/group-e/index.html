<h2 id="spain">Spain</h2>
<p>Spain has such a promising team in midfield and attack for sure. It all starts at the back with a great modern keeper in Unai Simon with Carvajal and Gaya at full-backs mostly and Torres and Laporte(if picked which is pretty certain). Midfield is amazing quality with Pedri and Gavi and Rodri holding fort over there. Pedri and Gavi are the ones to watch. Guillamón(CDM) is another one who is young and can play both CDM and CB. In attack, there are quite a few options in Ferran Torres, Sarabia and more with Morata or maybe Moreno at ST. The young players to watch here are Fati(LW), Nico Williams(RW), Yéremy Pino(RW) if they are selected. They can go far with Enrique.</p>
<h2 id="costa-rica">Costa Rica</h2>
<p>Keylor Navas has a huge mountain to climb here sadly cause this group is mighty tough with Spain and Germany. Maybe they could give Japan a fight but apart from that, I have no idea if they could do well.</p>
<h2 id="germany">Germany</h2>
<p>Victims of the defending champions curse. They had a really solid team last time out but didn&rsquo;t go beyond the group stages. Now they are looking much more dangerous under Hansi Flick. They have a good set of young players in Musiala, Bella-Kotchap(Who is pretty decent in the PL so far) and Moukoko. Hoping to see them go far in the tournament.</p>
<h2 id="japan">Japan</h2>
<p>I remember the old days when Japan had players like Shinji Kagawa and Keisuke Honda who would absolutely ball out for Japan. Now there is a new wave of talent for these guys and I&rsquo;m excited for it. The attack has players like Minamino, Kamada and Furuhashi. The wings are dangerous with the likes of Take Kubo and Ritsu Doan. In defense, we have the likes of Tomiyasu and Yoshida. Itakura is also someone who could be decent for them. There is a good bundle of talent here. Let&rsquo;s see</p>
