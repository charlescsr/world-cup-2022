            <p class="note title">Group C - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-29</p><p class="note content">Group C Argentina The last dance for Messi and Di Maria for sure will be bittersweet to watch as a Messi fan so I am planning to soak every moment. Messi has finally hit his GOAT stride at PSG so he is in really great form heading into the WC. Dybala&rsquo;s injury will certainly be a big blow for them but they have capable players in Di Maria, Gomez and Alvarez.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-b/">
            <p class="note title">Group B - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-26</p><p class="note content">Group B England An absolute golden generation of players continuously ruined by a terrible manager (Seriously can&rsquo;t wait till Howe or Potter manages this team). Anyways, they are pretty strong favorites to top the group but something is telling me in the later stages they can get found out. Patience is needed to break them down due to the 5 at the back system and their pace on the counter. Players to watch among a few are Sterling, Foden, Kane, and Mount.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-a/">
            <p class="note title">Group A - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-24</p><p class="note content">Group A Qatar The hosts of this World Cup. The reason for the shocking time to hold it. No use chatting about it now. Looking back on their previous games, the last game was a 2-0 win against Guatemala with 2 penalties. They did win a game against Egypt on penalties(They were without Salah and many major players but it still was a win). However, they are in for an uphill battle as they are grouped with Africa Cup of Nations winners Senegal, the Netherlands and a decent Ecuador.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/wc-groups/">
