            <p class="note title">Day 24</p><p class="note date">2022-12-13</p><p class="note content">Day 24 3-day break before the semi-finals Argentina v Croatia Messi messes up Gvardiol. Alvarez the new frontman. Lack of attack becomes Croatia&rsquo;s undoing
I was indeed pretty nervous thinking about this game due to Croatia&rsquo;s ability to hold teams to a shootout but in the end, it was relatively easy. The surprising spaces being left from the start were exploited easily by the Argentina players(The manager going for a 4-man midfield to hold Croatia which was executed well).<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_21/">
            <p class="note title">Day 21</p><p class="note date">2022-12-10</p><p class="note content">Day 21 Morocco v Portugal and England v France 2 games that were actually settled in normal time. Surprisingly normal ðŸ˜…. One was decided by a major error by the keeper otherwise it would have gone to penalties yet again. The second game was just well managed by France because England hardly had any open play chances and the one chance they had to equalize the second time Kane managed to bottle it.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_20/">
            <p class="note title">Day 20</p><p class="note date">2022-12-09</p><p class="note content">Day 20 2 day break after the Round of 16 Quarter Finals Croatia v Brazil and Argentina v Netherlands I am writing this just after the heartbreak. While it is still raw. I am just not interested at all in seeing that sad excuse of a game from Brazil again. Just when I had hoped these guys could go all the way to the final, they had to ruin it. The second was heated, to say the least.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_17/">
            <p class="note title">Day 17</p><p class="note date">2022-12-06</p><p class="note content">Day 17 End of Round of 16 Morocco v Spain and Portugal v Switzerland We have found our dark horses of this tournament. Ronaldo was dropped but was happy with the team&rsquo;s performance. His replacement takes the headlines. We have the last quarter-final which is going to be between Morocco and Portugal. Morocco knocking out Spain yet again(They lost to Russia in a PK shootout last WC ðŸ¤­). Portugal outplay Switzerland and Ramos was at the center of it all.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_16/">
            <p class="note title">Day 16</p><p class="note date">2022-12-05</p><p class="note content">Day 16 Japan v Croatia and Brazil v South Korea The first penalty shootout. Experience shines through and Brazil have a nice walk in the park. We have a quarterfinal between Brazil and Croatia. Japan&rsquo;s dream run comes to an end. Croatia just have the experience with penalty shootouts. Brazil have fun for Neymar&rsquo;s return. Let&rsquo;s dive in.
Match 1 Croatia&rsquo;s experience shines through. Japan should have been more attacking. Livakovic joins an exclusive club<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_15/">
            <p class="note title">Day 15</p><p class="note date">2022-12-04</p><p class="note content">Day 15 France v Poland and England v Senegal These results mean we have a mouth-watering clash between the holders and England. Will the holders roll through or will the English defense pen them back? We will know for sure on Saturday. Both games were great. One was all about Mbappe and the other was about moments that can happen if England can attack from the get-go.
Match 1 The Mbappe Show yet again.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_14/">
            <p class="note title">Day 14 - Start of Round of 16</p><p class="note date">2022-12-03</p><p class="note content">Day 14 Round of 16 Netherlands v USA and Argentina v Australia The results now mean we have got a rematch of the 2014 WC semifinal and Argentina had to rely on penalties to get through. Will we see more of that? Given how the Netherlands game went, maybe. One was a boring no-contest with goals and the other was a game that got really REALLY close toward the end but Argentina managed to hang on.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_13/">
            <p class="note title">Day 13</p><p class="note date">2022-12-02</p><p class="note content">Day 13 Final Matchday in Groups G and H Group H Ghana v Uruguay and Portugal v South Korea We called this group the &ldquo;Group of Death&rdquo;, at the very least me. It delivered massively on the final matchday. Uruguay prevented Ghana from getting revenge for 2010 but Korea provided it anyways by pipping Uruguay on goals scored(4 to Uruguay&rsquo;s 2) by beating Portugal who had a host of rotations. They have &ldquo;dreamed&rdquo; and they have achieved passage into the Round of 16.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_12/">
            <p class="note title">Day 12</p><p class="note date">2022-12-01</p><p class="note content">Day 12 Final Matchday in Groups E and F Group F Canada v Morocco and Croatia v Belgium One pretty alright game and one COMPLETE DUD from one of the teams in the other game. I thought Morocco will be able to give a great game to the other teams but never a group topper ðŸ˜…. It is an amazing show from the African nations. Maybe we could see more teams from AFCON because it is coming up.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_11/">
            <p class="note title">Day 11</p><p class="note date">2022-11-30</p><p class="note content">Day 11 Final Matchday in Groups C and D Group D Australia v Denmark and Tunisia v France 2 surprise results but only one of them mattered and that was Australia v Denmark. I never realized how bad they were and the fact that Australia managed to get into the Round of 16. Denmark lost twice and never won once. I never realized how bad they look without a proper ST like Poulsen.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
