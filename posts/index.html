Whoooo. WHAT. A. GAME ðŸ˜±. Definitely one of the best finals in World Cup history. Had an end-to-end game with 4 goals at the end of normal time and 6 at the end of extra time. This delivered on the major clash of Messi v Mbappe a million times over and I am still not over it.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_28/">

The first half was probably the major half in terms of chances and all that cause we had a bright bright start to it in 10 minutes. Croatia first got the lead through Gvardiol when a freekick was looped in and Perisic gave a good header towards him and he managed to throw himself to give the lead.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/final_preview/">

We have our 2 finalists. Argentina: Copa America and Finalissima winners and France: Defending Champions who have broken the status quo.
Will it be revenge and redemption for Messi and Argentina or will Mbappe and France completely shatter the defending champions curse???? As much as France have been great it hasn&rsquo;t gone unnoticed that they have become more pragmatic towards the end of the knockouts.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_25/">

Easy game for France. Harder for Morocco because they actually finally conceded playing the same park-the-bus tactics(Love to see it shatter immediately when a goal goes in because it makes you look like a proper idiot ðŸ¤£). It completely shifted both teams' game plans. France started sitting back which was pretty similar to England now that I think about it ðŸ¤”.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_24/">

I was indeed pretty nervous thinking about this game due to Croatia&rsquo;s ability to hold teams to a shootout but in the end, it was relatively easy. The surprising spaces being left from the start were exploited easily by the Argentina players(The manager going for a 4-man midfield to hold Croatia which was executed well).<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_21/">
            <p class="note title">Day 21</p><p class="note date">2022-12-10</p><p class="note content">Day 21 Morocco v Portugal and England v France 2 games that were actually settled in normal time. Surprisingly normal ðŸ˜…. One was decided by a major error by the keeper otherwise it would have gone to penalties yet again. The second game was just well managed by France because England hardly had any open play chances and the one chance they had to equalize the second time Kane managed to bottle it.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_20/">

While it is still raw. I am just not interested at all in seeing that sad excuse of a game from Brazil again. Just when I had hoped these guys could go all the way to the final, they had to ruin it. The second was heated, to say the least.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_17/">

Ronaldo was dropped but was happy with the team&rsquo;s performance. His replacement takes the headlines. We have the last quarter-final which is going to be between Morocco and Portugal. Morocco knocking out Spain yet again(They lost to Russia in a PK shootout last WC ðŸ¤­). Portugal outplay Switzerland and Ramos was at the center of it all.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_16/">

Experience shines through and Brazil have a nice walk in the park. We have a quarterfinal between Brazil and Croatia. Japan&rsquo;s dream run comes to an end. Croatia just have the experience with penalty shootouts. Brazil have fun for Neymar&rsquo;s return. Let&rsquo;s dive in.
Match 1 Croatia&rsquo;s experience shines through. Japan should have been more attacking. Livakovic joins an exclusive club<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
