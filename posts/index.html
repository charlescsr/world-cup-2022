            <p class="note title">Day 15</p><p class="note date">2022-12-04</p><p class="note content">Day 15 France v Poland and England v Senegal These results mean we have a mouth-watering clash between the holders and England. Will the holders roll through or will the English defense pen them back? We will know for sure on Saturday. Both games were great. One was all about Mbappe and the other was about moments that can happen if England can attack from the get-go.
Match 1 The Mbappe Show yet again.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_14/">
            <p class="note title">Day 14 - Start of Round of 16</p><p class="note date">2022-12-03</p><p class="note content">Day 14 Round of 16 Netherlands v USA and Argentina v Australia The results now mean we have got a rematch of the 2014 WC semifinal and Argentina had to rely on penalties to get through. Will we see more of that? Given how the Netherlands game went, maybe. One was a boring no-contest with goals and the other was a game that got really REALLY close toward the end but Argentina managed to hang on.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_13/">
            <p class="note title">Day 13</p><p class="note date">2022-12-02</p><p class="note content">Day 13 Final Matchday in Groups G and H Group H Ghana v Uruguay and Portugal v South Korea We called this group the &ldquo;Group of Death&rdquo;, at the very least me. It delivered massively on the final matchday. Uruguay prevented Ghana from getting revenge for 2010 but Korea provided it anyways by pipping Uruguay on goals scored(4 to Uruguay&rsquo;s 2) by beating Portugal who had a host of rotations. They have &ldquo;dreamed&rdquo; and they have achieved passage into the Round of 16.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_12/">
            <p class="note title">Day 12</p><p class="note date">2022-12-01</p><p class="note content">Day 12 Final Matchday in Groups E and F Group F Canada v Morocco and Croatia v Belgium One pretty alright game and one COMPLETE DUD from one of the teams in the other game. I thought Morocco will be able to give a great game to the other teams but never a group topper ðŸ˜…. It is an amazing show from the African nations. Maybe we could see more teams from AFCON because it is coming up.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_11/">
            <p class="note title">Day 11</p><p class="note date">2022-11-30</p><p class="note content">Day 11 Final Matchday in Groups C and D Group D Australia v Denmark and Tunisia v France 2 surprise results but only one of them mattered and that was Australia v Denmark. I never realized how bad they were and the fact that Australia managed to get into the Round of 16. Denmark lost twice and never won once. I never realized how bad they look without a proper ST like Poulsen.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_10/">
            <p class="note title">Day 10</p><p class="note date">2022-11-29</p><p class="note content">Day 10 Final Matchday in Group A and B Group A Netherlands v Qatar and Ecuador v Senegal With these results, Netherlands and Senegal have officially gone through. A massive kudos to both Senegal and Ecuador. Senegal after being AFCON champions is now through to the WC knockouts. I was skeptical because Mane was really influential but they managed to pull through. Ecuador you have a really young squad that will definitely learn from this and get stronger.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_9/">
            <p class="note title">Day 9</p><p class="note date">2022-11-28</p><p class="note content">Day 9 Cameroon v Serbia Game of the tournament. Why be picky when you can have both? Serbia complacency or not?
What a game this was. By far the game of the tournament. Serbia did well to come back from an early goal from Cameroon via Castelletto from the corner with goals from Milinkovic-Savic(Outside the box) and Pavlovic(Free kick). The second half is where the craziness began with Mitrovic giving Serbia a 2-goal lead after a load of passes inside the box.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_8/">
            <p class="note title">Day 8</p><p class="note date">2022-11-27</p><p class="note content">Day 8 Japan v Costa Rica I don&rsquo;t even wanna say much about this game. I have the highest disgust for the Japanese. They were all as inefficient as Timo Werner for Chelsea. It was a hard watch that I almost expected them to miss almost every time they attacked. Costa Rica held on so much and somehow managed to score with their first shot. If I am being brutally honest the goal wasn&rsquo;t that great because he managed to dig it out of his feet but the keeper should be doing better because he did get a hand on it.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_7/">
            <p class="note title">Day 7</p><p class="note date">2022-11-26</p><p class="note content">Day 7 Tunisia v Australia What a win for Australia. This is their first win since 2010. 12 years in the making and they deserved it. They managed to have the attacking threat and they found the breakthrough via Duke who managed to head in perfectly off a deflected cross from Goodwin. Apart from that one moment in the first half, the whole half was good defending from Australia after managing to block a golden chance from Tunisia.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_6/">
            <p class="note title">Day 6</p><p class="note date">2022-11-25</p><p class="note content">Day 6 Wales v Iran We have seen the first red card of this tournament and what surprised me is that they had to go to VAR to even give it. It was a clear high foot by Hennessey on Taremi which was a red from miles off. The irony that a new directive from FIFA managed to give Iran the win was kind of funny after my criticizing loads of added time.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
