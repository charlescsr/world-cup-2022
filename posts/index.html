            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - France</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - France Alright, defending champs. Strong squad. The only thing I am probably worried about is the lack of fullbacks with only Pavard and Theo Hernandez. No Ferland Mendy which is surprising. Maybe it could mean Deschamps is trying to push the 3 at the back system I think. Glad to see Varane in the squad still despite him missing the first game as a United fan. The midfield will be without Pogba and Kante who are very influential in general but in their stead, I am hoping Camavinga and Tchouameni will step up.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-h/">
            <p class="note title">Group H - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-11-02</p><p class="note content">Group H Portugal Quite possibly the last dance for Ronaldo he isn&rsquo;t exactly in the greatest of form but will most definitely be leading out this team in a tough group with the likes of Uruguay and so on. Unlucky that Diogo Jota is injured for this tournament. The attack is really well stacked anyways with the likes of Neto and Felix. The midfield has the likes of Bruno, Silva, Rafa Leao and Neves.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-g/">
            <p class="note title">Group G - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-11-01</p><p class="note content">Group G Brazil Can Brazil finally make sure to win another World Cup after 2002? Can Neymar banish the ghosts of the critics by winning a WC finally? These are the few questions that I am most certainly thinking about when coming to Brazil. I would really like to see the South American teams giving a tough fight to the European teams. In the last world cup, even with Neymar they went out on a whimper in the knockouts which was disappointing, to say the least.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-f/">
            <p class="note title">Group F - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-31</p><p class="note content">Group F Belgium With Belgium, one problem I have always found is their defense somehow always lets them down and with the guard being Vertonghen(35), Alderweireld(33) and Boyata(31) I am not surprised. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be as big an issue now due to the rise of young CBs such as Faes(24) and Theate(22) combined with the experience of Denayer(27) should be a really good backline for Courtois now. The midfield is absolutely packed with the likes of De Bruyne, Tielemans, Witsel and so on with young talents like Onana(21) for the CDM role.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-e/">
            <p class="note title">Group E - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-30</p><p class="note content">Group E Spain Spain has such a promising team in midfield and attack for sure. It all starts at the back with a great modern keeper in Unai Simon with Carvajal and Gaya at full-backs mostly and Torres and Laporte(if picked which is pretty certain). Midfield is amazing quality with Pedri and Gavi and Rodri holding fort over there. Pedri and Gavi are the ones to watch. Guillamón(CDM) is another one who is young and can play both CDM and CB.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-d/">
            <p class="note title">Group D - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-29</p><p class="note content">Group D France Defending champions. Will the World Cup curse strike for the 4th time? (Victims include: Italy, Spain, and Germany). They have got an amazing team. In defense, although Varane will be a big miss, they have got the likes of Koundé, Konaté, Upamecano, Saliba, Lucas, Theo and Pavard. In Midfield, Kante is a huge miss but there is quality again in Tchouaméni and Camavinga who are promising and are ones to watch for.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-c/">
            <p class="note title">Group C - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-29</p><p class="note content">Group C Argentina The last dance for Messi and Di Maria for sure will be bittersweet to watch as a Messi fan so I am planning to soak every moment. Messi has finally hit his GOAT stride at PSG so he is in really great form heading into the WC. Dybala&rsquo;s injury will certainly be a big blow for them but they have capable players in Di Maria, Gomez and Alvarez.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-b/">
            <p class="note title">Group B - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-26</p><p class="note content">Group B England An absolute golden generation of players continuously ruined by a terrible manager (Seriously can&rsquo;t wait till Howe or Potter manages this team). Anyways, they are pretty strong favorites to top the group but something is telling me in the later stages they can get found out. Patience is needed to break them down due to the 5 at the back system and their pace on the counter. Players to watch among a few are Sterling, Foden, Kane, and Mount.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/group-a/">
            <p class="note title">Group A - Summary</p><p class="note date">2022-10-24</p><p class="note content">Group A Qatar The hosts of this World Cup. The reason for the shocking time to hold it. No use chatting about it now. Looking back on their previous games, the last game was a 2-0 win against Guatemala with 2 penalties. They did win a game against Egypt on penalties(They were without Salah and many major players but it still was a win). However, they are in for an uphill battle as they are grouped with Africa Cup of Nations winners Senegal, the Netherlands and a decent Ecuador.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/wc-groups/">
