<h2 id="england">England</h2>
<p>An absolute golden generation of players continuously ruined by a terrible manager (Seriously can&rsquo;t wait till Howe or Potter manages this team). Anyways, they are pretty strong favorites to top the group but something is telling me in the later stages they can get found out. Patience is needed to break them down due to the 5 at the back system and their pace on the counter. Players to watch among a few are Sterling, Foden, Kane, and Mount. Keep an eye on Bellingham. Massive season so far and hoping he makes a bang in the WC.</p>

<h2 id="iran">Iran</h2>
<p>They have outside pressure to be replaced for Ukraine. Putting all that aside they have an ok team. Wales and the USA mean their work is cut out for them. Sardar Azmoun will be absolutely pivotal for them if he manages to stay fit and get service from the others. Alireza Jahanbakhsh is a fairly decent player. Maybe a few surprises could pop up from them</p>
<h2 id="usa">USA</h2>
<p>The US national team. Not as successful as their female counterparts but now they have quite a promising roster of young talent. We have gone from Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey to the likes of Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna. They have a good keeper in Matt Turner(Arsenal). A really decent midfield with the likes of Mckennie, Tyler Adams and Reyna. Maybe only a lack of experience is the only drawback.</p>
<h3 id="youngsters-to-watch-weahst-busiocm--adamscdm">Youngsters to watch: Weah(ST), Busio(CM),  Adams(CDM)</h3>
<h2 id="wales">Wales</h2>
<p>Wales is another team who is fairly average but have got good quality in some positions. Bale is always the main talisman for them. Brennan Johnson and Dan James are not bad. The goalie spot is the only one that doesn&rsquo;t give much confidence with Danny Ward being poor and Hennessey hardly getting game time ahead of Dean Henderson. If the GK spot is somehow sorted before the start maybe they could do decent</p>
