<h2 id="belgium">Belgium</h2>
<p>With Belgium, one problem I have always found is their defense somehow always lets them down and with the guard being Vertonghen(35), Alderweireld(33) and Boyata(31) I am not surprised. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s gonna be as big an issue now due to the rise of young CBs such as Faes(24) and Theate(22) combined with the experience of Denayer(27) should be a really good backline for Courtois now. The midfield is absolutely packed with the likes of De Bruyne, Tielemans, Witsel and so on with young talents like Onana(21) for the CDM role. On the wings, we have the ever present Eden Hazard, his brother Thorgan, Carrasco, Mertens along with young talents like De Ketelaere(ST) and Openda(ST). Will be keeping an eye on those talents.</p>
<h2 id="canada">Canada</h2>
<p>First WC since 1986. Phonzy(A. Davies - LB) and his men have a big task on their hands qualifying ahead of the likes of Croatia and Belgium who have pretty decent firepower on their side. Davies is also expected to be <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/alphonso-davies-quot-i-will-be-100-for-the-world-cup-quot-canada-back-for-first-time-since-1986/view/news/413584"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back</a>
 just before the WC starts which is great news and will be on the left side of the defense. Another talent I want to keep an eye on is Jonathan David(ST). The young striker is doing numbers for Lille in France but this WC could be a good way to gauge his play style and see how he works.</p>
<h2 id="morocco">Morocco</h2>
<p>Morocco don&rsquo;t have a bad squad but with the likes of Belgium and Croatia, we don&rsquo;t know if they can manage it. They have good players. Starting from defense they have Bono who plays for Sevilla and half-decent CBs in Sa√Øss and Aguerd(Plays for West Ham) and the fullbacks have the quality of Hakimi and Mazraoui. The midfield is pretty standard with the likes of Amrabat, Boufal, Harit(One to keep an eye on) and the attack has the likes of Ziyech, En-Nesyri so it is not half bad. Let&rsquo;s see if they can give tough competition.</p>
<h2 id="croatia">Croatia</h2>
<p>Finalists from the previous WC, Croatia won a load of hearts from that tournament for sure and they have a really good team to push Belgium and go through. In goal will probably be Livakovic. Gvardiol at the back is one to watch along with maybe Lovren. In midfield, the likes of Modric Kovacic and Brozovic are really solid. Up front, they have the likes of Kramaric(Man made me furious in a FIFA 22 Career mode I was doing and I dropped him). Brekalo and Pasalic could be good wing options maybe along with Vlasic.</p>
