<h2 id="brazil">Brazil</h2>
<p>Can Brazil finally make sure to win another World Cup after 2002? Can Neymar banish the ghosts of the critics by winning a WC finally? These are the few questions that I am most certainly thinking about when coming to Brazil. I would really like to see the South American teams giving a tough fight to the European teams. In the last world cup, even with Neymar they went out on a whimper in the knockouts which was disappointing, to say the least. Now hopefully Tite can get the absolute best out of this team. In goal, it&rsquo;s a toss-up between Alisson and Ederson. In defense, we have the rock-solid pair of Marquinhos and Thiago Silva. Fullbacks are my only worry with this team with options like Danilo, Telles and Sandro. Midfield is also really solid with the likes of Casemiro, Fred, Bruno G(Having a stonking season for Newcastle) and Fabinho. The attack is absolutely stacked with obviously Neymar, Gabriel Jesus, Rodrygo, Antony, Martinelli, Vini Jr. God that attack is good if it gels together which the coach has to manage.</p>
<h2 id="serbia">Serbia</h2>
<p>This group low-key has teams that should probably not be underestimated apart from Brazil only. I don&rsquo;t know anyone in particular in their defense apart from their goalie(Dmitrovic). Midfield is quite decent with the likes of <a href="https://www.sofascore.com/player/sergej-milinkovic-savic/331447"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SMS</a>
, Tadic, Kostic, Gudelj and Racic. The attack has options in Mitrovic and Jovic. Vlahovic is a doubt due to his injury so we don&rsquo;t know if the manager will pick him.</p>
<h2 id="switzerland">Switzerland</h2>
<p>I think this team on their day with the players they have could be really good and finish 2nd in this group. They had a wonderful Euros by beating France in a penalty shootout. Sommer is the mainstay at GK with a younger one in the wings in Kobel. Defense will mostly be Rodriguez, Akanji, Schar and Mbaby which is alright. Midfield has the likes of Xhaka(In good form for Arsenal), Zakaria, Freuler. The attack is obviously incomplete with the Big Shaq(X. Shaquiri - RW) and Embolo and led by the imposing Seferovic. I&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on Noah Okafor if he gets selected for sure.</p>
<h2 id="cameroon">Cameroon</h2>
<p>If Eto&rsquo;o was the main player back then, they have pretty much an equal replacement for him now: Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. As much as I laugh at him, he has absolutely been on it for Bayern this season and deserves the call-up. He will be a big threat based on form. Along with him could also be Mbuemo as well on the right as a threat. Midfield has the likes of Toko-Ekambi and Frank Anguissa which is really good. I don&rsquo;t really know anybody major in defense apart from the GK(Andre Onana).</p>
