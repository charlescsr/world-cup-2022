<h2 id="qatar">Qatar</h2>
<p>The hosts of this World Cup. The reason for the shocking time to hold it. No use chatting about it now. Looking back on their previous games, the last game was a 2-0 win against Guatemala with 2 penalties. They did win a game against Egypt on penalties(They were without Salah and many major players but it still was a win). However, they are in for an uphill battle as they are grouped with Africa Cup of Nations winners Senegal, the Netherlands and a decent Ecuador. Let&rsquo;s see what they can manage</p>
<h2 id="ecuador">Ecuador</h2>
<p>Looking at just their Copa America run recently gone by they were quarterfinalists but got humbled extremely by eventual winners Argentina. I think they could be good for maybe best placed 3rd team but apart from that I don&rsquo;t see them being ahead of Senegal and the Netherlands</p>
<h2 id="senegal">Senegal</h2>
<p>African Cup of Nations winners. They have quite a decent team that could challenge the Dutch and mostly do deserve to go at maximum 2nd place. Their last game was a 1-1 draw to Iran however and there are no more matches scheduled which doesn&rsquo;t give much confidence but they have the capable players to go to at least the quarters if they get the right draw. Mane and Dia are the main men in attack. Mane is a big threat down the left and Dia down the middle. The midfield of Gueye and Mendy is alright not amazing but not bad. Sarr is a good winger to have as well. At the back, Koulibaly will have to be the main man for them as always.</p>

<h2 id="netherlands">Netherlands</h2>
<p>Overwhelming favorites to top the group in my opinion. Louis Van Gaal has come back with a bang and the team has developed well. Van Dijk, De Ligt and Timber is a solid back 3 with depth in the fullbacks as well with Blind and Dumfries and Malacia and Frimpong. Midfield is maybe somewhere they have to be alert in cause I don&rsquo;t think they have the greatest players in Berghuis, De Roon and Klaasen(This midfield however managed to beat Belgium 1-0 in the Nations League so it&rsquo;s not that bad). Frenkie De Jong has finally hit some consistent games for Barca so hoping he gets in. Gravenberch could add some quality in that area if needed but he&rsquo;s hardly playing for Bayern. The attack is where the firepower lies. Gakpo, Bergwijn, Depay, Malen to name a few. An outside shout is probably Xavi Simons from PSV to add to it as well.</p>
