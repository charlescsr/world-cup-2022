<p>So Suarez and Cavani are picked for the squad which is nice to see. One final time seeing that attacking duo probably but with Nunez coming up it&rsquo;s hard to keep them together. In goal, the coach seems to trust Rochet more than Muslera so I would probably do the same. In defense Araujo is a very surprising pick given his expected return is in December if he underwent surgery he could maybe play but we need to wait and see how it develops. Apart from him, Gimenez is a surety alongside probably Caceres and the fullbacks will mostly be Olivera and Varela on the left and right respectively. Olivera and Vina are OTW on the left. In the center of midfield, we can for sure expect Valverde to start given his amazing form for Real Madrid and Bentancur will mostly start alongside him. Vecino and Torreira are present for more defensive options. On the wings, I would really like to see Pellistri on the right. He&rsquo;s OTW along with Canobbio as well who usually can be found starting as well. On the left, you can expect to see probably de la Cruz. In attack, you will most definitely see Suarez and Nunez will start more compared to Cavani I think due to him being younger.</p>
<p>The lineup:</p>
