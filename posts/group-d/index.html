<h2 id="france">France</h2>
<p>Defending champions. Will the World Cup curse strike for the 4th time? (Victims include: Italy, Spain, and Germany). They have got an amazing team. In defense, although Varane will be a big miss, they have got the likes of Koundé, Konaté, Upamecano, Saliba, Lucas, Theo and Pavard. In Midfield, Kante is a huge miss but there is quality again in Tchouaméni and Camavinga who are promising and are ones to watch for. Paul Pogba can still do the business for France and can hopefully do good after coming back from injury(<a href="https://twitter.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1587123217201713152"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Immediate Jinx</a>
). Diaby and Guendouzi are also youngsters to keep an eye on. Dembele has had a massive resurrection at Barca so expect to see more of him. There is just a lot of quality to cover. Mbappe will always be the main man up top for the French. One thing is: Will we see Ballon D&rsquo;Or winner Benzema at the WC? Time will tell.</p>
<h2 id="australia">Australia</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know their players as much apart from Mat Ryan(GK) and Mooy(CM). They are mostly going to be fighting with Tunisia for 3rd and 4th mostly. They arrived here by beating Peru via a penalty shootout(after a 0-0 draw)</p>
<h2 id="denmark">Denmark</h2>
<p>These guys balled out in the Euros. A semi-final appearance in that tournament. They have got the team to finish comfortably in 2nd place in this group. Eriksen is a man reborn ever since the <a href="https://charlescsr.github.io/euro-diaries-2020/posts/day-1/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bad news</a>
 from the Euros and he will be a pivotal part once again for the Danish. Kasper Schmeichel is once again a great leader to have and a good keeper. Kjaer and Christensen will be vital at the heart of the defense. Maele and Damsgaard are good on the wings with Damsgaard hoping to back up his great Euros performance with another one here. Up front, the options are fairly decent in Dolberg and Poulsen.</p>
<h2 id="tunisia">Tunisia</h2>
<p>Only know 2 players here in Khazri and Mejbri. Excited to see Mejbri if he does get called up which I hope he does. The last match wasn&rsquo;t a great one: losing 5-1 to Brazil and getting a player sent off. Apart from that, another notable player is Skhiri who plays in the Bundesliga for Koln.</p>
