            <p class="note title">Day 17</p><p class="note date">2022-12-06</p><p class="note content">Day 17 End of Round of 16 Morocco v Spain and Portugal v Switzerland We have found our dark horses of this tournament. Ronaldo was dropped but was happy with the team&rsquo;s performance. His replacement takes the headlines. We have the last quarter-final which is going to be between Morocco and Portugal. Morocco knocking out Spain yet again(They lost to Russia in a PK shootout last WC ðŸ¤­). Portugal outplay Switzerland and Ramos was at the center of it all.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_16/">
            <p class="note title">Day 16</p><p class="note date">2022-12-05</p><p class="note content">Day 16 Japan v Croatia and Brazil v South Korea The first penalty shootout. Experience shines through and Brazil have a nice walk in the park. We have a quarterfinal between Brazil and Croatia. Japan&rsquo;s dream run comes to an end. Croatia just have the experience with penalty shootouts. Brazil have fun for Neymar&rsquo;s return. Let&rsquo;s dive in.
Match 1 Croatia&rsquo;s experience shines through. Japan should have been more attacking. Livakovic joins an exclusive club<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_15/">
            <p class="note title">Day 15</p><p class="note date">2022-12-04</p><p class="note content">Day 15 France v Poland and England v Senegal These results mean we have a mouth-watering clash between the holders and England. Will the holders roll through or will the English defense pen them back? We will know for sure on Saturday. Both games were great. One was all about Mbappe and the other was about moments that can happen if England can attack from the get-go.
Match 1 The Mbappe Show yet again.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_14/">
            <p class="note title">Day 14 - Start of Round of 16</p><p class="note date">2022-12-03</p><p class="note content">Day 14 Round of 16 Netherlands v USA and Argentina v Australia The results now mean we have got a rematch of the 2014 WC semifinal and Argentina had to rely on penalties to get through. Will we see more of that? Given how the Netherlands game went, maybe. One was a boring no-contest with goals and the other was a game that got really REALLY close toward the end but Argentina managed to hang on.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_13/">
            <p class="note title">Day 13</p><p class="note date">2022-12-02</p><p class="note content">Day 13 Final Matchday in Groups G and H Group H Ghana v Uruguay and Portugal v South Korea We called this group the &ldquo;Group of Death&rdquo;, at the very least me. It delivered massively on the final matchday. Uruguay prevented Ghana from getting revenge for 2010 but Korea provided it anyways by pipping Uruguay on goals scored(4 to Uruguay&rsquo;s 2) by beating Portugal who had a host of rotations. They have &ldquo;dreamed&rdquo; and they have achieved passage into the Round of 16.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_12/">
            <p class="note title">Day 12</p><p class="note date">2022-12-01</p><p class="note content">Day 12 Final Matchday in Groups E and F Group F Canada v Morocco and Croatia v Belgium One pretty alright game and one COMPLETE DUD from one of the teams in the other game. I thought Morocco will be able to give a great game to the other teams but never a group topper ðŸ˜…. It is an amazing show from the African nations. Maybe we could see more teams from AFCON because it is coming up.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_11/">
            <p class="note title">Day 11</p><p class="note date">2022-11-30</p><p class="note content">Day 11 Final Matchday in Groups C and D Group D Australia v Denmark and Tunisia v France 2 surprise results but only one of them mattered and that was Australia v Denmark. I never realized how bad they were and the fact that Australia managed to get into the Round of 16. Denmark lost twice and never won once. I never realized how bad they look without a proper ST like Poulsen.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_10/">
            <p class="note title">Day 10</p><p class="note date">2022-11-29</p><p class="note content">Day 10 Final Matchday in Group A and B Group A Netherlands v Qatar and Ecuador v Senegal With these results, Netherlands and Senegal have officially gone through. A massive kudos to both Senegal and Ecuador. Senegal after being AFCON champions is now through to the WC knockouts. I was skeptical because Mane was really influential but they managed to pull through. Ecuador you have a really young squad that will definitely learn from this and get stronger.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_9/">
            <p class="note title">Day 9</p><p class="note date">2022-11-28</p><p class="note content">Day 9 Cameroon v Serbia Game of the tournament. Why be picky when you can have both? Serbia complacency or not?
What a game this was. By far the game of the tournament. Serbia did well to come back from an early goal from Cameroon via Castelletto from the corner with goals from Milinkovic-Savic(Outside the box) and Pavlovic(Free kick). The second half is where the craziness began with Mitrovic giving Serbia a 2-goal lead after a load of passes inside the box.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_8/">
            <p class="note title">Day 8</p><p class="note date">2022-11-27</p><p class="note content">Day 8 Japan v Costa Rica I don&rsquo;t even wanna say much about this game. I have the highest disgust for the Japanese. They were all as inefficient as Timo Werner for Chelsea. It was a hard watch that I almost expected them to miss almost every time they attacked. Costa Rica held on so much and somehow managed to score with their first shot. If I am being brutally honest the goal wasn&rsquo;t that great because he managed to dig it out of his feet but the keeper should be doing better because he did get a hand on it.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
