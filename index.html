            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Brazil</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Brazil Guess my fears were true in the end. Fullbacks seem like the only weakness for Brazil here with only Alex Sandro/Alex Telles on the left and Danilo/Dani Alves on the right. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am happy Alves is somehow there in the lineup but it&rsquo;s seriously weird seeing weak options there compared to literally everywhere else in the team. In goal, I think Ederson would mostly start but Alisson has made many saves but it will be a headache.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_england/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - England</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - England The big one I was actually waiting for. My expectations for Southgate were low but wow he absolutely went even low. Heavy imbalance, too many out-of-form players, some fatigue and dropping people who you would rather build the team around. It&rsquo;s an absolute joke how the FA(Football Association) is allowing this League 1(Tier 3 of English football) coach even manage a bloody NATIONAL TEAM. The worst part of it is they are scared to hire anyone foreign.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_uruguay/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Uruguay</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Uruguay So Suarez and Cavani are picked for the squad which is nice to see. One final time seeing that attacking duo probably but with Nunez coming up it&rsquo;s hard to keep them together. In goal, the coach seems to trust Rochet more than Muslera so I would probably do the same. In defense Araujo is a very surprising pick given his expected return is in December if he underwent surgery he could maybe play but we need to wait and see how it develops.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_portugal/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Portugal</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Portugal On the left: Goalkeepers and Defenders On the right: Midfielders and Attackers
Stacked team. Ronaldo&rsquo;s possible last dance. Isn&rsquo;t in the greatest of form but will be expected to lead this team after their Euro win in 2016 and Nations League win in 2019. They have really good quality everywhere. They will miss Jota through injury but have good players instead of him. Starting at the back Diogo Costa has to start every game because he has been on it for Porto and recently signed a new contract.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_poland/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Poland</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Poland Order: Goalkeepers, Defenders, Midfielders, Attackers
With the likes of Mexico and Argentina in their group here is hoping Lewandowski can do well in possibly his last World Cup. The usual system at play for Poland seems to be a 3 at the back formation so I&rsquo;ll probably be centering my lineup with the same formation. In goal, Szczesny is a mainstay and Dragowski is a young development keeper who can hopefully take over from him.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_germany/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Germany</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Germany Left: Goalkeepers, Defenders Right: Midfielders/Attackers
Germany will most definitely be missing the likes of Kroos(Retired from international duty), Reus(Injured. Can&rsquo;t catch a break) and Werner(Injured. He was in good form too). This is going to be a big tournament for the likes of Bella Kotchap(Having a good season for Southampton), Schlotterbeck(Doing well for Dortmund), Raum(Young and a decent LB), Moukoko(Amazing season for him Dortmund. Contract expiring in the summer), Musiala(Worth 100 million Euros), Adeyemi(Ok start I&rsquo;d say for Dortmund).<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_belgium/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Belgium</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Belgium Like I said in my team summary this is a decent squad in general and the one selected for this tournament is no different. This team has been forever named a dark horse but with the sheer quality they have I expected them to do really well at tournaments but they haven&rsquo;t delivered as much as I thought. A 3rd place finish last time in the World Cup is good but not enough.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_morocco/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Morocco</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Morocco The order is: Goalkeepers, Defenders, Midfielders, Attackers
This is an okay team in my opinion. With the likes of Belgium and Croatia, it is an uphill battle for Morocco. Ziyech is selected despite playing fewer games and being out of form for Chelsea but I get the reasoning. You sometimes have to have your most talented players.
In goal, we have Bono who is a half-decent keeper for Sevilla and is no slouch.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_swi/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Switzerland</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Switzerland Credit to Goal.com for the simplification
Fairly decent time in the last Euros where they managed to knock out the current WC defending champions France on penalties. The squad is fairly decent with a few young options up front like Okafor and Embolo and a GK in Kobel. Sommer is injured but will be back in time for their first fixture maybe it could be time to trust in Kobel a little more.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_usa/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - USA</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - USA From the days of seeing only Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan, I have got to say I am liking the look of this USA team honestly. A good keeper in Matt Turner. Good defense in Robinson, Dest, Scally, Yedlin and Zimmerman. There is a decent midfield in Mckennie, Acosta, Aaronson and Adams. The forward line is also really good with the LeBron James of Soccer(C. Pulisic - LW), Gio Reyna who is doing well for Dortmund.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
