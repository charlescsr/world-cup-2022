            <p class="note title">Day 10</p><p class="note date">2022-11-29</p><p class="note content">Day 10 Final Matchday in Group A and B Group A Netherlands v Qatar and Ecuador v Senegal With these results, Netherlands and Senegal have officially gone through. A massive kudos to both Senegal and Ecuador. Senegal after being AFCON champions is now through to the WC knockouts. I was skeptical because Mane was really influential but they managed to pull through. Ecuador you have a really young squad that will definitely learn from this and get stronger.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_9/">
            <p class="note title">Day 9</p><p class="note date">2022-11-28</p><p class="note content">Day 9 Cameroon v Serbia Game of the tournament. Why be picky when you can have both? Serbia complacency or not?
What a game this was. By far the game of the tournament. Serbia did well to come back from an early goal from Cameroon via Castelletto from the corner with goals from Milinkovic-Savic(Outside the box) and Pavlovic(Free kick). The second half is where the craziness began with Mitrovic giving Serbia a 2-goal lead after a load of passes inside the box.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_8/">
            <p class="note title">Day 8</p><p class="note date">2022-11-27</p><p class="note content">Day 8 Japan v Costa Rica I don&rsquo;t even wanna say much about this game. I have the highest disgust for the Japanese. They were all as inefficient as Timo Werner for Chelsea. It was a hard watch that I almost expected them to miss almost every time they attacked. Costa Rica held on so much and somehow managed to score with their first shot. If I am being brutally honest the goal wasn&rsquo;t that great because he managed to dig it out of his feet but the keeper should be doing better because he did get a hand on it.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_7/">
            <p class="note title">Day 7</p><p class="note date">2022-11-26</p><p class="note content">Day 7 Tunisia v Australia What a win for Australia. This is their first win since 2010. 12 years in the making and they deserved it. They managed to have the attacking threat and they found the breakthrough via Duke who managed to head in perfectly off a deflected cross from Goodwin. Apart from that one moment in the first half, the whole half was good defending from Australia after managing to block a golden chance from Tunisia.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_6/">
            <p class="note title">Day 6</p><p class="note date">2022-11-25</p><p class="note content">Day 6 Wales v Iran We have seen the first red card of this tournament and what surprised me is that they had to go to VAR to even give it. It was a clear high foot by Hennessey on Taremi which was a red from miles off. The irony that a new directive from FIFA managed to give Iran the win was kind of funny after my criticizing loads of added time.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_5/">
            <p class="note title">Day 5</p><p class="note date">2022-11-24</p><p class="note content">Day 5 Switzerland v Cameroon Alright game I would say. Cameroon started with Choup-Moting over Aboubaker which had a different outlook on the game. Real good chances from Cameroon but the Swiss defense stood firm through it all. Everybody did their job really well. Major chances in the first half came to Cameroon and the major chance came for the Swiss via Akanji from the corner. Second half Switzerland managed to increase their influence and Embolo managed to score after a good cross from Shaqiri.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_4/">
            <p class="note title">Day 4</p><p class="note date">2022-11-23</p><p class="note content">Day 4 Morocco v Croatia The 3rd goalless draw. This is already more than in 2018 when there was only 1. This was however one of the dud ones. There weren&rsquo;t enough clear-cut chances yet again. It was eventful but the shots were all over the place. The keepers were hardly tested. Mazraoui had to come off due to an injury sadly. Ez Abde came on for Morocco. He was lively but he wasn&rsquo;t much of a passer.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_3/">
            <p class="note title">Day 3</p><p class="note date">2022-11-22</p><p class="note content">Day 3 Argentina v Saudi Arabia Well. First of all massive kudos to Saudi Arabia. Their system was absolutely solid with a high line to catch the Argentina attack out regularly. Argentina actually scored 3 offside goals. They just couldn&rsquo;t get the runners in behind well enough. First, a soft penalty was given when Paredes was pulled down in the box during a corner. Fairly soft but VAR thought otherwise and Messi calmly slotted home.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_2/">
            <p class="note title">Day 2</p><p class="note date">2022-11-21</p><p class="note content">Day 2 England v Iran Great game from England. Southgate actually ditched the 5-back formation which means the sky is officially falling. Wowwwwww I am surprised. Iran was seriously not even close anywhere. There were like I thought. Very defensive and tried to break on the counter. Due to that, they got one of the goals from Taremi. Dunno why Azmoun didn&rsquo;t start but he got some minutes. If they don&rsquo;t get their act together I think USA and Wales will have good shot against them.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/day_1/">
            <p class="note title">Day 1</p><p class="note date">2022-11-20</p><p class="note content">Day 1 Qatar V Ecuador Definitely the worst opening match in the history of the whole tournament. I can&rsquo;t believe I really thought Qatar could give a match against Ecuador. This is also the first time ever in the history of the World Cup that the host nation has lost its first match. Even Russia had a better game than this lot. Ecuador hardly broke a sweat in this game. The second half was really just chilling from them.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
