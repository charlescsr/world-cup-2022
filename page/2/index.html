            <p class="note title">Day 1</p><p class="note date">2022-11-20</p><p class="note content">Day 1 Qatar V Ecuador Definitely the worst opening match in the history of the whole tournament. I can&rsquo;t believe I really thought Qatar could give a match against Ecuador. This is also the first time ever in the history of the World Cup that the host nation has lost its first match. Even Russia had a better game than this lot. Ecuador hardly broke a sweat in this game. The second half was really just chilling from them.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_serbia/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Serbia</p><p class="note date">2022-11-11</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Serbia In a group that contains Brazil, Cameroon and Switzerland. Honestly, I think they and Switzerland are genuine contenders for the second spot. Those 2 teams can cause an upset too. My lineup is solely based on their values so bear with me. In goal, a Milinkovic Savic could be trusted or Rajkovic. In defense, it&rsquo;s a back 3 of the likes of Pavlovic, Milenkovic, Erakovic mostly with the usual Veljkovic injured with an unknown return date so let&rsquo;s see if he&rsquo;ll be back.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_arg/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Argentina</p><p class="note date">2022-11-11</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Argentina Alright. Copa America winners. Winners of the Finallissima. Their team looks amazing actually. I genuinely hope they do another 2014. In goal, Emi Martinez is a lock-in. In defense, Lisandro Martinez should definitely play after his amazing start at United. Alongside him, Romero or Otamendi should be good enough. In the fullback positions, I would perhaps go Tagliafico and Montiel. In midfield, Paredes or Palacios for the CDM role.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_spain/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Spain</p><p class="note date">2022-11-11</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Spain A lot of controversy from Enrique with De Gea being left out of the provisional 55-man squad. My feeling is that the relationship severed after Euro 2020. He relies on playing well from the back including the goalie. Even though De Gea has relatively improved under Ten Hag in that aspect, he still has a long way to go. Unai Simon is already good at that aspect.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_dutch/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Netherlands</p><p class="note date">2022-11-11</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Netherlands Alright, I am liking the look of this squad. This is the first World Cup for the likes of Van Dijk and Pasveer(Take a bow. Being the first choice for Ajax at 39). Van Gaal has really made a turnaround after that spell with Manchester United. The system is likely to be a 3-back system which has worked out well for them. In goal, Pasveer could be starting in goal but Bijlow is OTW as well so hoping he could have a game or so as well.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_senegal/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Senegal</p><p class="note date">2022-11-11</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Senegal Left: Goalkeepers, Midfielders, Manager/Coach Right: Defenders, Attackers
Well well well. This is an interesting selection from the coach. Sadio Mane will in fact be going to the World Cup despite being injured. They are hoping he will make a comeback during the tournament at the very least. With the Netherlands being the only possible threat, I think they have what it takes to finish second at least.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_brazil/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Brazil</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Brazil Guess my fears were true in the end. Fullbacks seem like the only weakness for Brazil here with only Alex Sandro/Alex Telles on the left and Danilo/Dani Alves on the right. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I am happy Alves is somehow there in the lineup but it&rsquo;s seriously weird seeing weak options there compared to literally everywhere else in the team. In goal, I think Ederson would mostly start but Alisson has made many saves but it will be a headache.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_england/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - England</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - England The big one I was actually waiting for. My expectations for Southgate were low but wow he absolutely went even low. Heavy imbalance, too many out-of-form players, some fatigue and dropping people who you would rather build the team around. It&rsquo;s an absolute joke how the FA(Football Association) is allowing this League 1(Tier 3 of English football) coach even manage a bloody NATIONAL TEAM. The worst part of it is they are scared to hire anyone foreign.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_uruguay/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Uruguay</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Uruguay So Suarez and Cavani are picked for the squad which is nice to see. One final time seeing that attacking duo probably but with Nunez coming up it&rsquo;s hard to keep them together. In goal, the coach seems to trust Rochet more than Muslera so I would probably do the same. In defense Araujo is a very surprising pick given his expected return is in December if he underwent surgery he could maybe play but we need to wait and see how it develops.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/world-cup-2022/posts/squad_reaction_portugal/">
            <p class="note title">Squad Reaction - Portugal</p><p class="note date">2022-11-10</p><p class="note content">Squad Reaction - Portugal On the left: Goalkeepers and Defenders On the right: Midfielders and Attackers
Stacked team. Ronaldo&rsquo;s possible last dance. Isn&rsquo;t in the greatest of form but will be expected to lead this team after their Euro win in 2016 and Nations League win in 2019. They have really good quality everywhere. They will miss Jota through injury but have good players instead of him. Starting at the back Diogo Costa has to start every game because he has been on it for Porto and recently signed a new contract.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
